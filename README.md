## General info
<p> These are my notes and problems I solved while learning python, specifically for ML and includes some projects as well.</p>
<p> The main aim of this repository is to help sort out all the essentials required for ML using python.</p>
<p> I'm using Jupyter notebook as it provides you with an easy-to-use, interactive data science environment that doesn't only work as an IDE, but also as a presentation or educational tool. </p>
<p> All the files are in ***.ipynb*** format and you can easily access them using jupyter notebook.
